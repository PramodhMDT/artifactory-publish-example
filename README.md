# artifactory-publish-example

An example of deploying artifacts of a multi-module Gradle project to Artifactory.

This repo provides examples for using both the [Artifactory Plugin](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Gradle+Artifactory+Plugin) as well as using the older
[Maven Publish Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html).

## Prerequisites
This example requires a running Artifactory instance. If you do not already have one, start a dockerized version using these [instructions](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Installing+with+Docker).
